\section{Introduction}

Analyzing triangles is an important task in network analysis. We
present some sampling based algorithms for tackling such problems;
e.g. estimating the top-$k$ triangles in a weighted, undirected
graph ordered by the mean of the edge weights, estimating the
top-$k$ triangles in a weighted, undirected graph ordered by the
number of simplices the triangles appear in, etc.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\section{Geometric Mean of Edge Weights}

\subsection{Problem}
Given
a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer $k$, output a list
of the top-$k$ triangles ordered by the mean of their edge 
weights. For now, we will focus on simple undirected graphs with positive
edge weights, and we will consider the case where we order
triangles according to the \emph{geometric} mean of the edge
weights.

Given an edge $e = (u,v) \in E(G)$, let $w_{uv} = w_e$ denote the
weight of this edge. The geometric mean of a triangle defined by
vertices $a, b, c$ is $(w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca})^{1/3}$. Since the
cube is a monotonic function, we will instead consider ordering the 
triangles by the cube of their geometric means,
$w_{ab} w_{bc} w_{ca}$, for simplicity.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Algorithm}

Our overall approach is similar to diamond sampling 
for the maximum all-pairs dot-product search problem 
\cite{diamond}. While the overall approach is similar we
do not have an analogue of a ``diamond'' in our case and thus,
the dependency on the number of samples needed is worse than
in \cite{diamond}. Nevertheless, our approach is a promising
one and improving upon it using an analogue of a ``diamond''
could be the next step.

At a high level, we sample edges $(a,b), (a,c)$
and $(b,c')$ such that $b \neq c$ and $a \neq c'$
with probability proportional to the product of their weights,
$w_{ab}w_{bc'}w_{ca}$. Thus, these edges will either form a 3-path 
or a triangle.
If $c \neq c'$, then these edges do not
form a triangle and we discard this sample.
If $c=c'$, then these edges form a triangle and we increment a 
counter $x_{abc}$ associated with this triangle.
Intuitively, we expect that triangles whose product of edge weights
is higher will have a higher counter value, and we can output the
triangles associated with the top-$k$ counters.

For a vertex $a \in V$ let $N(a)$ denote the set of its neighbors
in $G$, ie. $N(a) = \{b \in V : (a,b) \in E\}$.
Set
\begin{align}
\tilde p_{ab} &= w_{ab} \sum\limits_{a' \in N(a) \setminus b}w_{aa'} \sum\limits_{b' \in N(b) \setminus a}w_{bb'} \label{eq:tildep}\\
Z &= \sum\limits_{(a,b) \in E}\tilde p_{ab} \label{eq:z}\\
Z(a,b) &= \sum\limits_{a' \in N(a) \setminus b}w_{aa'} \label{eq:zab}
\end{align}

\subsection{Analysis}

A na\"ive algorithm for this problem might be to sample triangles
uniformly at random and then pick the top-$k$ of them based on the
product of their edge weights. However, intuitively we would expect
that sampling triangles proportional to the product of their edge
weights would perform better. We will show that this is indeed the 
case.
Recall that $x_{abc}$ is a counter associated with the triangle
formed by vertices $a,b$ and $c$ and represents the number of 
times this triangle was sampled.
We will show that the expected value of $x_{abc}$ is equal to
the product of the edge weights of the corresponding triangle
upto a multiplicative factor. Then, we will show that depending
on the desired error and error probability, if we take a sufficient
number of samples, then this expectation is tightly concentrated.
Our analysis is very similar to that in \cite{diamond}.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\delta_{abcc'}$ be the event of choosing edges $(a,b), (a,c)$ and $(b,c')$. Then, $P(\delta_{abcc'}) = w_{ab} w_{bc'} w_{ca} / Z$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Event $\delta_{abcc'}$ occurs when we first choose edge $(a,b)$,
and conditioned on that we choose edges $(a,c)$ and $(b,c')$. Thus,
using equations \ref{eq:tildep}, \ref{eq:z} and \ref{eq:zab} we get
\begin{align*}
  P(\delta_{abcc'}) &= P(\text{choosing }(a,b))\ P(\text{choosing }(a,c) \mid (a,b))\ P(\text{choosing }(b,c') \mid (a,b))\\
  &= \frac{\tilde p_{ab}}{Z} \frac{w_{ac}}{Z(a,b)} \frac{w_{bc'}}{Z(b,a)}\\
  &= \frac{w_{ab} \sum\limits_{a' \in N(a) \setminus b}w_{aa'} \sum\limits_{b' \in N(b) \setminus a}w_{bb'}}{Z} \frac{w_{ac}}{\sum\limits_{a' \in N(a) \setminus b}w_{aa'}} \frac{w_{bc'}}{\sum\limits_{b' \in N(b) \setminus a}w_{bb'}}\\
  &= \frac{w_{ab} w_{bc'} w_{ca}}{Z}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Let $T$ denote the number of triangles sampled
out of a total of $s$ samples.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:expectation}
$E[x_{abc}] = \frac{T}{Z} w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $X_{abcl}$ be a random variable defined as follows. In
iteration $l$, if edges $(a,b)$ and $(a,c)$ are sampled,
then $X_{abcl}$ is equal to $I[c=c']$, where $c'$ is the 
endpoint of the third sampled edge $(b,c')$. Otherwise, it 
is equal to 0. Note that $x_{abc} = \sum\limits_{l} 
X_{abcl}$. Using linearity of expectation, we get that
$E[x_{abc}] = \sum\limits_{l=1}^s E[X_{abcl}] = \sum\limits_{l=1}^s \sum\limits_{c'} P(\delta_{abcc'})I[c=c'] =\frac{T}{Z} w_{ab} w_{bc} w_{ca} $.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:concentration}
Let $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ be the error and $\delta \in (0,1)$ be
the error probability.
If the number of sampled triangles
\begin{equation*}
  T \geq 3 Z \frac{\log{(2/\delta)}}{\epsilon^2 w_{ab} w_{bc} w_{ca}},
\end{equation*}
then
\begin{equation*}
  P(|x_{abc} - \frac{T}{Z}w_{ab} w_{bc} w_{ca} | > \epsilon \frac{T}{Z}w_{ab} w_{bc} w_{ca}) \leq \delta.
\end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Note that $x_{abc} = \sum\limits_{l=1}^{s} X_{abcl}$ and
$X_{abcl}$ is equal to 1 if the sampled edges have 
$c = c'$, 0 otherwise. These indicator variables are also
independent across the $s$ iterations. Thus, using the
Chernoff bound, we get $P(x_{abc} - \frac{T}{Z}w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca} > \epsilon \frac{T}{Z}w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca}) \leq \exp{(-\epsilon^2 \frac{T}{Z}w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca}/3)}$.
Given our choice of $T$, the right hand side is at most 
$\delta/2$. Using the Chernoff bound again for the other 
tail and using the union bound, we obtain the desired result.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\tau > 0$ be some threshold and $\delta \in (0,1)$ be
the error probability.
If the number of sampled triangles
\begin{equation*}
  T \geq 12 Z \frac{\log{(n^3/\delta)}}{\tau},
\end{equation*}
then with probability at least $1 - \delta$, the following
holds for all triangles $\{a,b,c\}$ and $\{a',b',c'\}$: if
$w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca} > \tau$ and $w_{a'b'}w_{b'c'}w_{c'a'} <
\frac{\tau}{15}$, then $x_{abc} > x_{a'b'c'}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider a triangle $\{a,b,c\}$ with $w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca} > 
\tau$. Applying lemma \ref{lemma:concentration} with
error $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$ and error probability
$\frac{\delta}{n^3}$, we get that $x_{abc} > \frac{1}{2}
\frac{T}{Z} w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca} \geq \frac{T}{Z} \frac{\tau}{2}$.
Now consider a triangle $\{a',b',c'\}$ with $w_{a'b'}w_{b'c'}w_{c'a'} < \frac{\tau}{15}$. Applying the
lower tail bound of Theorem 1.1 part 3 from \cite{concentration-book}, we get $\forall t > 2e E[x_{a'b'c'}],\ P(x_{a'b'c'} > t) < 2^{-t}$. Applying lemma 
\ref{lemma:expectation} and using the assumption that the
weight of this triangle is less than $\frac{\tau}{3}$, we 
get $E[x_{a'b'c'}] = \frac{T}{Z}w_{a'b'}w_{b'c'}w_{c'a'}
\leq \frac{T\tau}{16Z}$. Since we require $2e E[x_{a'b'c'}]
< t$, or equivalently, $2e \frac{T\tau}{16Z} < t$, we can
set $t = \frac{T\tau}{2Z}$. Using our assumption on the
number of sampled triangles $T$, we get that $t \geq 12 Z
\frac{\log{(n^3/\delta)}}{\tau} \frac{\tau}{2Z}$.
Simplifying this expression yields $t \geq 6 \log{\frac{n^3}{\delta}}$. Thus, $P(x_{a'b'c'} > \frac{T}{Z} \frac{\tau}{2}) < \frac{\delta}{n^3}$.
Taking a union bound over at most $n^3$ triangles we get the
following result. With probability at least $1-\delta$
if triangle $\{a,b,c\}$ has $w_{ab}w_{bc}w_{ca}>\tau$, then
$x_{abc} \geq \frac{T}{Z} \frac{\tau}{2}$, and if triangle
$\{a,b',c'\}$ has $w_{a'b'}w_{b'c'}w_{c'a'} < 
\frac{\tau}{15}$, then $x_{a'b'c'} \leq \frac{T}{Z}\frac{\tau}{2}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Sampling in $O(\log(\text{degree}))$ - Rejection Sampling}

In algorithm \ref{alg:sampling} once we sample the edge
$(a,b)$, the normalization constant for the probability
of sampling $c$ from $N(a) \setminus b$, $Z(a,b)$, 
depends on $b$. This precludes us from sampling $c$
in $O(\log(d_a))$ time, where $d_a$ refers to the degree
of vertex $a$, unless we use $O(d_a^2)$ space to store
$d_a$ probability vectors of length $O(d_a)$ each, one
for each possible choice of $b$ for vertex $a$. Since
this might be prohibitive, we would have to settle for
sampling $c \in N(a) \setminus b$ in $O(d_a)$ time
instead.

A possible solution to this problem is to simply sample
$c \in N(a)$ and use rejection sampling, i.e. discard
$c = b$ and keep sampling till we sample $c \neq b$.
In order for this solution to be efficient, we would like
guarantees on how many trials we would need to ensure
we encounter a vertex $c \neq b$ from $N(a)$.
Let $Z' = \sum\limits_{a' \in N(a)} w_{aa'}$ and
$p = 1 - \frac{w_{ab}}{Z'}$. Observe that the number of
trials needed to choose $c \neq b$ follows a geometric
distribution, $\text{Geom}(p)$, with success probability
$p$ as defined above referring to the probability of
choosing a neighbor of $a$ other than $b$. Thus,
$P(\text{number of trials needed} = x) = (1-p)^{x-1} p
= (\frac{w_{ab}}{Z'})^{x-1} (1 - \frac{w_{ab}}{Z'})$.
As long as $w_{ab}$ does not account for a huge fraction
of the weights on the edges incident to $b$ a moderate
number of trials should suffice to sample $c \neq b$.
The lower the probability of sampling $b$ the lower the 
probability of needing $x$ trials. If
$\frac{w_{ab}}{Z'} = 0.9$, then $P(x=5) = 0.0651$.
If $\frac{w_{ab}}{Z'} = 0.1$, then $P(x=5) = 9e-05$.

Empirically, we observe that the algorithm \ref{alg:sampling}
with rejection sampling is generally an order of magnitude faster
than without rejection sampling. The quality of the results is
either comparable or even better with rejection sampling, especially
for larger graphs.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Sampling in $O(\log(\text{degree}))$ - Alternative}
\label{sec:alt_sampling}

We can also sample a neighbor of $a$ from $N(a) 
\setminus b$ in
$O(d_a)$ time without using rejection sampling by
using the following algorithm.
For each vertex $a$, create
array of the cumulative sums of the
weights of the neighbors of $a$. Since the weights
are assumed to be non-negative this array will be
sorted in increasing order. For ease of 
presentation, denote the weights as $w_1, w_2, \dots,
w_d$ and suppose we would like to sample a neighbor
from $[1, d]$ excluding neighbor $i$. Thus, the
array of cumulative sums have 
have the values $c_1=w_1, c_2=w_1+w_2,
\dots, c_d=w_1+w_2+\dots+w_d$. First, sample a uniform
random number between 0 and $Z(a,b)$, where $Z(a,b) = 
\sum\limits_{a'\in N(a) \setminus b} w_{aa'}$.
If $u$ does not land in interval $i$, return the
interval it landed in.
Otherwise, do the following. Flip a coin with probability
of heads equal to $c_{i-1}$. If heads, generate a random
number between $1$ and $i-1$. Otherwise, generate a random
number between $i+1$ and $d$.
% If $u \leq c_{i-1}$ then search for $u$ between
% $c_1$ and $c_{i-1}$. Otherwise, search for $u+w_i$
% between $c_{i+1}$ and $c_d$.

Paul has a different 
algorithm for doing the same. In order to sample
$c \in N(a) \setminus b$, first sample a uniform random
number $u$ between 0 and $Z(a,b)$.
Thinking about the weights of the edges $w_{aa'}$ as
intervals, check which interval $u$ lies in. If it lies
in the interval corresponding to $w_{ab}$ implicitly
divide it into $d_a - 1$ subintervals, each
corresponding to each of the other neighbors of $a$ and
return the neighbor corresponding to the subinterval
that $u$ lies in. If this interval is the largest one,
precompute a data structure that can return the answer
efficiently. If not, then just do rejection sampling.
In expectation, this will take at most 2 trials since
the interval we want to exclude will be at most half of the
total weight.
Otherwise, return the interval
$u$ lies in.

\section{Arithmetic and Harmonic Mean of Edge Weights}

\subsection{Problem}
Given a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer $k$, 
output a list
of the top-$k$ triangles ordered by the arithmetic or 
harmonic mean of their edge 
weights. For now, we will focus on simple undirected graphs 
with positive edge weights. For simplicity, for a triangle
defined by vertices $a, b, c$ we will consider the sum
of the edge weights or the sum of the inverse of the edge
weights instead.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Algorithm}

\subsubsection{Approach 1}

One approach could be to reduce this problem to the one for 
geometric mean. If we consider the exponential of the edge weights
then we would sample a triangle with probability proportional to
$\exp(w_{ab}) \exp(w_{bc}) \exp(w_{ca}) = \exp(w_{ab} + w_{bc} +
w_{ca})$. However, this will lead to overflow since some of the
weights in real world networks are quite large. One possible
solution is to divide the weights by the maximum edge weight so
that all the weights are at most $e$. One possible issue is that
this would place too ``squeeze'' the weights into a narrow
region and bias the sampling probabilities in unintended ways.
Instead, we consider the following algorithm.

\subsubsection{Approach 2}

The algorithm is the same as the one in the section
on ordering triangles by geometric mean of edge weights
with the difference being the sampling probabilities
for sampling an edge $(a,b)$ and neighbors $c$ and $c'$.
The following probabilities will sample triangles with
probability proportional to the sum of edge weights, i.e.
for the arithmetic mean case. For harmonic mean, replace the
edge weights with the inverse of the edge weights.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample $(a,b)$ with probability $\propto \left((d_a-1)\cdot 
(d_b-1) \cdot w_{ab} + (d_b-1) \sum\limits_{a'\in N(a) \setminus b} 
w_{aa'} + (d_a-1) \sum\limits_{b' \in N(b)\setminus a} w_{bb'}\right)$. 
\item Sample $c \in N(a) \setminus b$ with probability 
$\propto \left((d_b-1) \cdot (w_{ac} + w_{ab}) + \sum\limits_{b' \in N(b)\setminus a}
w_{bb'}\right)$. 
\item Sample a neighbor $c' \in N(b) \setminus a$ with probability 
$\propto \left(w_{ac} + w_{ab} + w_{bc'}\right)$.  
\end{enumerate}
Normalize the probabilities over all edges, all vertices in
$N(a) \setminus b$ and all vertices in $N(b) \setminus a$
respectively.

\subsubsection{Approach 3}

Another simpler algorithm is the following. In each iteration, sample an edge
with probability proportional to its weight. For each sampled edge, iterate
over all neighbors of the endpoints of the edge and count the number of
triangles that contain this edge. Then, a triangle defined by vertices $a,b$
and $c$ is counted with probability $w_{ab} + w_{bc} + w_{ca}$. The time
complexity to count all triangles for a given edge is $d_u + d_v$, but this
only needs to be done once at the end of the sampling loop.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Analysis}

The analysis is the same as for the geometric mean with the
product of edge weights replaced by the sum of edge weights
or the sum of the inverse edge weights for arithmetic and
harmonic mean respectively.

%---------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------

\section{Number of Simplices (Closed Triangles)}
\label{sec:number_closed}

\subsection{Problem}
Given a set of $p$ simplices $\{S_i : i \in [p]\}$ and
an integer $k$, output a list of the top-$k$ closed 
triangles ordered by their weight, where weight of a 
triangle is defined as how many simplices the triangle 
appears in.
A triangle $\{a,b,c\}$ is closed if all three vertices
appear together in some simplex.
For example, if $S = \{\{a,b,c,d\}, \{a,b,c,e\}, 
\{a,d\} \}$ then the weight of triangle $\{a,b,c\}$ is
2 since it appears in 2 simplices, $S_1$ and $S_2$.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Algorithm}

Our approach is similar to diamond sampling for
the maximum all-pairs dot-product (MAD) search 
problem \cite{diamond}.
At a high level, the algorithm works as follows. Given the list
of simplices $S$ and the projected graph $G_S$, we create a
tripartite graph with a set of nodes $A$ for edges in $G_S$,
a set of nodes $B$ for nodes in the input, and 
a set of nodes $C$ for simplices.
Let $a \in A, b \in B$ and $c \in C$. Since $A$
represents edges in the projected graph, let $a = (u,v)
\in E(G_S)$. There is an edge between $a$ and $c$ iff
edge $a = (u,v)$ appears in simplex $c$ and there is an
edge between $b$ and $c$ iff node $b$ appears in simplex
$c$. We will set the sampling probabilities appropriately,
and sample a ``diamond'' from this tripartie graph similar to
\cite{diamond}.  
If the ``diamond'' corresponds to a closed triangle,
we increment a counter associated with this closed triangle.
Intuitively, we expect that closed triangles which appear in 
more simplices will have a higher counter value, and we can
output the closed triangles associated with the top-$k$
counters. 

Let $a=(u,v) \in A, b \in B$ and $c \in C$. The weight of the
edge between $a$ and $c$, $w_{ac}$, is equal to 1 if $a$ appears in
simplex $c$, 0 otherwise. The weight of the edge between 
$b$ and $c$, $w_{bc}$, is equal to 1 if $b$ appears in simplex $c$.
Normalize the weights to get sampling probabilities
$p_{ac} = w_{ac}/W_1$ and $p_{bc} = w_{bc}/W_2$,
where $W_1$ and $W_2$ are the normalizing constants.

\begin{algorithm}\label{alg:closedsampling}
  \caption{Sampling Closed Triangles}
  \SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}
  \SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}
  \Input{A set of simplices $S$, number of samples $s$.}
  \Output{Counters $x$ initialized to $0$.}
  Let $A = \{a = (u,v) : \exists S_i \in S, u,v \in S_i \}$.\\
  Let $B$ be the set of vertices in the input.\\
  Let $C$ be the set of simplices in the input.\\
  \For{$l = 1 \dots s$}{
    Sample edge $(a,c)$ with probability $p_{ac}$.\\
    Sample edge $(b,c)$ with probability $p_{bc}$.\\
    \If{$a=(u,v)$ and $b$ is equal to $u$ or $v$}{
        continue
    }
    Sample edge $(a,c')$ with probability $p_{ac'}$.\\
    $x_{ab} \leftarrow x_{ab} + w_{bc'}$.
  }
  \KwRet{$x$}
\end{algorithm}

Then, we use algorithm \ref{alg:postprocess} to postprocess and output the result.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Analysis}

The analysis is almost identical to \cite{diamond} with a few
of minor modifications.
$x_{ab}$ is a counter associated with
the closed triangle defined by edge $a$ and third vertex $b$,
and $\sum\limits_c w_{ac}w_{bc}$ is equal to the number of 
simplices that the closed triangle defined by edge $a$ and 
third vertex $b$ appears in.
Additionally, the dependence is on the number of closed triangles sampled, $T$,
and not the number of samples $S$ since some of the samples might 
sample a vertex $b$ which is an endpoint of the sampled edge $a$ and this
is not a triangle.

The number of nodes in this tripartite graph is $O(m + n + |S|)$.
Each of the two sets of edges will be sparse.
Each simplex contains a small number of vertices and thus,
the set of edges between $B$ and $C$ will be sparse.
The distribution of edge weights in the projected graph is skewed
towards 1, with only a few edges having very high weight. In our construction,
the number of outgoing edges from $a \in A$ is equal to the weight
of the edge corresponding to node $a$ in the projected graph,
and thus, the set of edges between $A$ and $C$ will be sparse.


%---------------------------------------------------------
%---------------------------------------------------------

\section{Number of Simplices (All Triangles)}

\subsection{Problem}
Given a set of $p$ simplices $\{S_i : i \in [p]\}$ and
an integer $k$, output a list of the top-$k$
triangles ordered by their weight, where weight of a 
triangle is defined as the number of simplices which
contain at least one edge of the triangle.
For example, if $S = \{\{a,b,x\}, \{b,c,y\}, 
\{a,c,z\}, \{a,u,v\} \}$ then the weight of triangle $\{a,b,c\}$ is
3 since $S_1$ contains edge $\{a,b\}$, $S_2$ contains
$\{b,c\}$ and $S_3$ contains $\{a,c\}$.

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Algorithm}
Our approach is similar to diamond sampling for the maximum
all-pairs dot-product (MAD) search problem \cite{diamond} and
algorithm \ref{alg:closedsampling} for ordering closed
triangles by the number of simplices they appear in as stated
in section \ref{sec:number_closed}.
At a high level, the algorithm works as follows. Given the list
of simplices $S$ and the projected graph $G_S$, we create a 4-partite
graph with a three sets of nodes $A,B$ and $D$ for edges 
in $G_S$, and a set of nodes $C$ for simplices. Let
$a,b,c,d \in A,B,C,D$. There is an edge from $x = a,b,d$
to $c$ iff at least one endpoint of the edge represented by
$x = a,b,d$ is in simplex $c$.  We will set the sampling probabilities
appropriately, and sample a ``diamond'' from this 4-partite 
graph. If the ``diamond'' corresponds to a triangle, we
increment a counter associated with this triangle. Intuitively,
we expect that triangles which appear in more simplices will have
a higher counter value, and we can output the closed triangles
associated with the top-$k$ triangles.

Similar to the previous section, we will set the weight of each
edge to be 1 and normalize them to get sampling probabilities.

\begin{algorithm}\label{alg:allsampling}
  \caption{Sampling All Triangles}
  \SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}
  \SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}
  \Input{A set of simplices $S$, number of samples $s$.}
  \Output{Counters $x$ initialized to $0$.}
  Let $A = \{a = (u,v) : \exists S_i \in S, u,v \in S_i \}$.\\
  Let $B = D = A$.
  Let $C$ be the set of simplices in the input.\\
  \For{$l = 1 \dots s$}{
    Sample edge $(a,c)$ with probability $p_{ac}$.\\
    Sample edge $(b,c)$ with probability $p_{bc}$.\\
    Sample edge $(d,c)$ with probability $p_{dc}$.\\
    \If{edges $a,b,d$ do not form a valid triangle}{
        continue
    }
    Sample edge $(a,c')$ with probability $p_{ac'}$.\\
    $x_{abd} \leftarrow x_{abd} + w_{bc'} w_{dc'}$.
  }
  \KwRet{$x$}
\end{algorithm}

Then, we use algorithm \ref{alg:postprocess} to postprocess and output the result.

\subsection{Analysis}

The analysis is similar to the previous section with the following
modification: $\sum\limits_c w_{ac}w_{bc}w_{dc}$ is equal to the
number of simplices which contain at least 1 edge of the
triangle defined by the edges $a, b$ and $d$. One concern is that
we might need quite a few trials to sample a valid triangle in each
iteration. We will observe the empirical performance of the algorithm
and see how well it performs.

\section{Common \nth{4} Neighbor}

\subsection{Problem}

Given a list of triangles and an integer $k$,
output a list of the top-$k$ triangles ordered
by the number of common \nth{4} neighbors, or
equivalently, the number of 4-cliques the 
triangle is part of.  

%---------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Algorithm and Analysis}

A simple deterministic algorithm for this 
problem is to store the neighbors of every
vertex in the graph as a sparse vector, and
for each triangle compute the sparse dot product
between the 3 sparse vectors representing the 
neighbors of the 3 vertices of the triangle.
This will output the number of common \nth{4}
neighbors for each triangle and we can output
the triangles corresponding to the $k$ largest
of these. This will take $O(T * d_{\text{max}} + T * 
\log{k})$ time where $d_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum 
degree of the vertices of the graph.

However, we would like a sampling based 
algorithm whose time complexity is not linear in
the degree. A simple sampling based algorithm
is to iterate through the triangles and for each
triangle, randomly sample some neighbors of the
vertices of the triangle and see how many of
them are common \nth{4} neighbors. Fix some vertex
of the triangle and let $d$ denote its degree. 
(We may want to pick the vertex of the triangle with
the lowest degree.)
Suppose we pick $s$ samples from these $d$ vertices
uniformly at random. How many of these would be
common \nth{4} neighbors? Let $X_i$ be an indicator
random variable that is equal to 1 if sample $i$
is a common \nth{4} neighbor, 0 otherwise. Let
the estimator be
$\tilde C = \frac{d}{s} \sum\limits_{i=1}^s X_i$.
Let $C$ be the true number of common \nth{4} neighbors
for the chosen triangle.
% \begin{lemma}
% $E[\tilde C] = C$ and $V[\tilde C] = \frac{1}{s}C(d-C)$.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% By linearity of expectation, we have that
% $E[\tilde C] = \frac{d}{s} \times s \times E[X_1] = 
% d P(X_1 = 1)$. Since we sample a vertex uniformly
% at random from $d$ vertices in the neighbor list out
% of which $C$ are common \nth{4} neighbors, $P(X_1 = 1)
% =\frac{C}{d}$. Thus, $E[\tilde C] = C$ and $\tilde{C}$
% is an unbiased estimator.
% 
% Since the samples are independent across iterations,
% we have that $V[\tilde C] = \frac{d^2}{s^2} \times
% s \times V[X_1] = \frac{d^2}{s} V[X_1] = \frac{d^2}{s}
% \frac{C}{d} (1-\frac{C}{d}) = \frac{1}{s} C(d-C)$.
% \end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
$E[\tilde C] = C$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By linearity of expectation, we have that
$E[\tilde C] = \frac{d}{s} \times s \times E[X_1] = 
d P(X_1 = 1)$. Since we sample a vertex uniformly
at random from $d$ vertices in the neighbor list out
of which $C$ are common \nth{4} neighbors, $P(X_1 = 1)
=\frac{C}{d}$. Thus, $E[\tilde C] = C$ and $\tilde{C}$
is an unbiased estimator.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
Let $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ be the accuracy parameter and
let $\delta \in (0,1)$ be the confidence parameters.
If $s \geq \frac{\ln(2/\delta)}{(2\epsilon)^2}$, then
$P(|\tilde C - C| \geq \epsilon) \leq \delta$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
$\tilde C = d \times \frac{1}{s} \sum\limits_{i=1}^2 X_i$,
where $X_i$ is an indicator random variable that is equal
to 1 if sample $i$ is a common \nth{4} neighbor, 0 otherwise.
Thus, the result follows by Hoeffding's inequality.
\end{proof}
Note that we would like $s \ll d$, otherwise we might as
well use the deterministic solution.
